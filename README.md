# Scheduler
This is a C program to simulate a running operation system’s scheduling of processes.  The code will be one thread only and the processes’ are just data structures used in the simulation.You will have 3 * 16 processes, 3 for each priority from 0-15.  One that is CPU bound, one that is even CPU and I/O and 1 that is I/O bound.  CPU bound must want more time than normally allowed in CPU before fast I/O spending most time in CPU.  I/O bound should stay in CPU much less time than normal  CPU time and spend most time waiting for I/O.  Even should spend about the same amount of time in CPU as doing I/O. here should be several data structures. A priority queue of processes ready for the CPU. Each time click (one time around the main loop) you adjust priorities and move processes in this queue. A list of processes waiting for I/O. A struct of OS parameters common to all processes. Max time in CPU before being bumped to ready queue if no I/O. Max wait time user processes in ready queue.
